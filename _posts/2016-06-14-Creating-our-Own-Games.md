We have started work on our own games!

At the end of this week's lesson we wrote a plan for our own games. With my friend, George, I thought of the idea of a dodgeball game where you are a blinking dot on the bottom of the screen and you have to dodge falling dots from the top representing balls. We had to think of the input, the process and the output in our plan. For our game, the input will be shake to start, the A button to move left and the B button to move right. The process would be changing the position of the LED representing the character and a random number generator for where the balls fall. The output would then be the lights changing.
