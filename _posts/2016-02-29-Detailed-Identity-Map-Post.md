Hi! I'm back with a more detailed review of my identity map.

I enjoyed creating my identity map. It took a fair bit of effort, but I enjoyed doing the drawing and putting 'me' on paper. Some things I felt I’d rather not put on there though, so I didn’t. All I put on there was what I’m comfortable with other people knowing. If I was told to put absolutely everything on there, I would not only be a bit uncomfortable but I would be fed up because it would take so long! But putting only what I wanted on there, I enjoyed the experience. The way we presented our maps to class was to simply put them down on the table in front of us and let them write comments on an A4 sheet. I think this method was by far the most efficient, but some things I would have liked to present personally, most likely because I didn’t put it on there clearly enough. I think that the way we presented them was best, and I was pleased that we would be sharing them in this way, particularly because it’s far more easy to get feedback!

On the other hand, there was the matter of writing feedback on others sheets. I would have liked a long time to read some of them, so I could write a more detailed response than just "good, more colour". Sometimes I felt a bit uncomfortable writing what I thought was true, or finding other words than “nice”. However, I did enjoy writing positive comments and seeing others read them.

The process of read, write, move that we followed, I felt, was definitely the best way of doing it. But again, for me, it was too rushed. But on some I felt it was far too slow!

After all of the moving and commenting, I really enjoyed reading the comments that my classmates had written for me. All was positive other than the fact that my writing was hard to read because I chose the wrong pens (which was no surprise as my dad had already said this to me after it was too late!).

The way we did it was different from if we hadn't know the person (such as reading a stranger's social media page). The way it was different was that we didn’t have to make assumptions and doing it this way with people we know means that we can fill in the gaps. The problem was though, I think that knowing the person meant that we have been a bit biased. 

I think that most of the things on my identity map, I could social media without out trouble. But some more personal things and exactly where I live (which both went on there) could both be dangerous and possibly too detailed to make fully public. These things are things I would happily trust my friends with but not anyone who manages to find me by accident in a search.

I don't use any social media websites at the moment, but if I had, creating this map might have made me change some things if I had put some dangerous detail on my page. This would certainly have made me think twice about what I post. Other than that, with generic media, I haven’t made any changes to the way I use it, other than making a few more video calls with friends during the weekend just for fun, rather than homework which is how they usually start!

The recent topic of media hasn't changed my view of the media much, but It has shown me that social can be used for good things, not just pointless mind wasting typing!

The lessons have changed my view of using social media in a profession, or when I'm older because I can see that they are useful tools for work, as you can obtain useful resources as well as issuing a mass message instantly or in case of emergency. The lessons have changed my view of me using social media for my job in the future, but I still don’t intend to use any now.

Thanks for reading,

SLW
