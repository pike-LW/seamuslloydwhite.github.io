This week our Micro:Bits finally arrived (the things we have been coding for for ages!) and we had a class discussion.

We started off by loading our code onto our Micro:Bits but we quickly moved on to a new discussion topic: revenge porn and sexting.

Of course both of these are awful. Revenge porn is where in a relationship break up, one or both of the people involved in  the relationship posts to a social media site sexual pictures of the other. It is illegal and can result in a fine, imprisonment or both.

Sexting is similar in the way of sending pictures of people naked to others, but it is not always from a relationship. It can be used as blackmail to say that you'll post pictures of someone if they donâ€™t do something you have asked. It can also be dirty flirting.
