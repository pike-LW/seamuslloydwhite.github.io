Binary

In my latest IT lesson which I unfortunately missed and had to catch up on I learnt about binary. It's the system that computers use to run. A computer is basically a lot of on of switches. For example, when you hit the spacebar it turns on a binary code put onto a tiny chip in your computer and so carries out the coded action. The way it works is quite simple. Using our normal numeric system we have 10 symbols to represent our numbers. So every time we add a digit to the left of that number, it must be ten times greater than the number before it. But in binary we only have two digits, 0 and 1. So every time we add a digit to the left of that number, it must be twice the value. REMEMBER: Never count a zero in your calculations because it?s value is nothing. 

If I had the digit 1, it is worth 1, but if I have 10, it's worth 2. Confused? Well, we start with 1. 1 x 2 is 2, but in binary we times by two by moving the digits across a  place. So why can?t I use 11 as 2? Because you still have to add the second 1 making it 3, but if you use zero, we don?t count that digit and so get 2.

Here's a link to a good video if you?re still confused:
