Hi! Today in IT we looked at what to do if something goes wrong in a situation and something gets online and out of hand. We looke at CEOP, a website that can help in that sort of situation.

We looked at the first to a million video quiz/series. Go check it out for yourself on YouTube before you read this post. If things go like they did in classâ€¦

I personally believe that the class made the wrong decisions when we were doing it which led to the end we got to with pornography being filmed without permission and then being posted and getting out of hand. Once we had finished with the videos and seen the outcomes of the problem (relationship failure, falling out bullying and trauma), we looked at CEOP, the website for help, where you can make a report and get counseling and help. You can make a report and get the problem solved. There educational website is called thinkuknow.
