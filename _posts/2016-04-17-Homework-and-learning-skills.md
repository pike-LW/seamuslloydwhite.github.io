Today I talk about learning and homework skills.

This is how to get high marks on your homeworks:

1. Always check!

2. Listen to the instructions and write them down FULLY.

3. Go over your grammar, spellings and punctuation.

4. Check that even it's appearance isnâ€™t too much.

5. DO NOT EVER COPY AND PASTE
