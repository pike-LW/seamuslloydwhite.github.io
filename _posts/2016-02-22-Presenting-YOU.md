Hello!

In my last IT lesson we looked at how we want to present ourselves. By presenting ourselves, I mean our behaviour, our image and how we talk and what we talk about. So we all probably present ourselves differently to our teachers (being polite, not talking about random things!) than how we might present ourselves to our siblings or our friends. We need to be careful about how people will view us, as it will affect how we react when talking to that person. So just consider before you go into a classroom, can I really keep talking now I'm coming in? You need to set lunch aside and settle into your "work and impress the teacher" mode. Imagine that when you talk to somebody and when you meet somebody, pretend that you’re giving them a presentation about you. What do you want them to know, what do you want to hide? Be aware of how you are when you’re around other people. However, don’t get fanatical about absolutely everything about you, don’t perfect everything little thing. Just be yourself. But, make sure that that person won’t hurt anybody!
