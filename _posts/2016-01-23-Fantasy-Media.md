HI 

In IT this week we looked closer again at analysing the media. The thing that we focused mainly on was fantasy within adverts. We looked at not getting drawn into things that aren't real and identifying when it was true. So for example, a younger child is watching an advert for a pair of shoes. In the advert it demonstrates a boy and a girl getting new shoes and being able to fly with them. Obviously it isn't true, but a younger child might not understand it. What the advert might really be trying to say is it feels like you’re walking on a cushion of air. It doesn’t have to be a younger child though. Something things can be more discrete fantasy and even pul adults in, so you have to be careful. 

Thanks for reading,

SLW
