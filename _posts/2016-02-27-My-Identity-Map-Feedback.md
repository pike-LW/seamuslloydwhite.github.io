Hello!

After last week's post, our homework was to create an identity map of our own, and show how we want to present ourselves. Mine had my hobbies, my family, my house and significant above other things. I think I filled the whole A3 page well, and so did my classmates commenting mainly on my use of colour and detailed writing. The only negative comment I received was about my handwriting being hard to read, as I used a quite thick felt tip pen to write. Overall, I was very pleased with my feedback and felt that I didnâ€™t need to change my map in order to get a good grade.
