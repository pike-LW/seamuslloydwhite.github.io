Hello everybody!

	I my IT lesson this week we learnt about media literacy. Media means communication. So it can be paintings, books, TV, social media, games and much more. 

	Media literacy is the ability to look at, create and analyze media. So when we were looking at it we took time to look at an advert, see the basic message and the initial story and then look at it more closely. When we did this, we looked at target audience, which is who you're trying to get to buy your product, secret meanings and links that might eventually cause you to buy the product and backstories that make you think about it about it a bit more. We watched this advert where these hamsters were getting fitter at the same time a car was being upgraded. What the advert was trying to say was: these hamsters have been upgraded like our car, and they're good because of it, and you could be to if you by our car. And this all just goes into our minds without us noticing and might eventually make us buy the product.

Thank you for reading, see you all soon,

SeamusLW
