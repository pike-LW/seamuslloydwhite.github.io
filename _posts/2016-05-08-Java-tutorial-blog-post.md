This week in IT we had a go at some of the Java tutorials on BBC Micro:bit.

We used the online cookbook to help us to create games and activities in Java. The final one I did was The Worst Snake Ever. In it, I learnt a bit about boolean and creating globals. In the end, I created a game where you chase a dots around the screen. I enjoyed it a lot, despite some of it being quite challenging.
