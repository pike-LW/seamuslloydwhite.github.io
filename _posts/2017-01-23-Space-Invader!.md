    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>My partner and I worked exactly to the book, but after that we changed some things. I prefer keeping to the tutorials and understanding thoroughly what we are doing, whilst my partner prefers changing things. This week we introduced a turn system, where one person types and the other read, and then we swap after each tutorial.</td>

    <td>Today we really struggled saving our work to our USB drives. We spent a lot of time struggling with multiple tabs and trying to work out where our work had saved to.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next week, we will try and save up faster in order to complete more work. Now we know how to do this, I think we will be able to improve in this area.
