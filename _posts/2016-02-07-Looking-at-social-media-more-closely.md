Hi! today we're going to be having a closer look at social media.

Let's go back to the advantages. We have contacting people from further away, mass messaging, we can obtain resources, and video chat. We can have a lot of fun on social media. My favourite thing to do would be looking at funny pictures and videos and national geographic is good fun to follow. But it’s not only other people that are a danger on social media. YOU could be the problem. It could be the way you interpret things, like losing self-esteem because you’ve "seen" somebody with an allegedly better life. Also spending far too much time on it is just wasting your life, and some people can become so obsessive that they even post pictures of their food and even their feat! So just be careful that you don’t become one of them, and only look at useful things and use it in emergencies.

Thanks again, 

SLW
