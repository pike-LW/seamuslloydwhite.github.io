Hello guys!

On Wednesday this week in IT we looked at computer safety. We learnt about different hack types and how to be safe on your email account. It wasn't what was planned, but hey! We got loads of random stories about grannies with Iphones and other strange stories about viruses!

First we talked about fishing. Fishing is a lowly way of gaining money by getting people to give you money via email. They can do this by saying things such as: " If you can give me ?500 a month, I can pay you back 5 million". Of course, they keep asking for more and more then walk off. Another one was: ? I'm stranded in Spain. Can you send me some money to get back??. Also things like ?get an Iphone 7 for free!? and ?URGENT EMAIl? popping up on your screen can cause havoc if you click on them, because it will redirect you to a site where your hard-earned cash will be nicked. Also you need to be sure that you read what you're ticking because if you accidentally tick something because you haven?t read it, it?s legal to take your money. Once apple released an update where you pledged your soul to them if you downloaded it without reading it!

Next we talked about hacking. There are three main types of hackers: White Hat Hackers, Black Hat Hackers and White Hat Hackers.

White Hat hackers get into your computer to see where they can improve theirs, so they're fine.

Black Hat Hackers get into your computers and illegally steal your data to sell on, or your money. Bad news.

Grey Hat Hackers are the odd ones. They do bad things "for the greater good". This sort of thing is illegal. It might include stealing secret government data that they think the public should know. You're thinking ?great, I have a right to know what?s going on?. You would be right, but quite often it does nothing but cause trouble. A current group of Grey Hat Hackers who call themselves Anonymous, have caused havoc before and are currently trying to stop all social media feeds about Isis.

We also talked about Wikipedia and the BBC. According to my IT teacher, wikipedia is more trustworthy than the BBC. Wikipedia is led by a team of "dedicated nerds" that try to prove us wrong. We're led into believing the BBc is better because it?s an official organisation, but actually they put lots of untrue things out there just to make a stir up about an untrue story. A good example is the ?incident?  where Boris Johnson allegedly went past a red light and mounted the pavement. This made out that  he had committed a crime, when in reality he was just cycling and didn?t slow quick enough and so when a few inches past the light and put his foot on the pavement in order to stop.

Thank you for reading! See you all soon!
